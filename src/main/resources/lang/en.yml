#Every verbal output the plugin will ever display to the final player will be taken from here.
#Yuo can either customize the messages and texts to make them fit into your server's tone
#or copy this file and rename it to a different language code to translate the plugin to whatever language
#you want to support on your server.

#The language is client-side picked, so it'll depend on the language set in the Player's client which language file
#the output is going to be pucked from. You can support as much languages as you want.

#LandLords has build-in neutral English, neutral LATAM Spanish and European Spanish translations. We encourage you
#to change the "default_language" setting in the config.yml file to your target player's native language, and
#implementing your own translation if it's not build-into the plugin.

#The plugin will try to match the player with the file named after their "language + country" pair, so you can implement
#location-specific translations for different regions with the same language. if there's found no translation matching
#this combination, the translation named after just the language will be picket.
#   - en_US.yml   ==>   Will be used for players in the US
#   - en_UK.yml   ==>   Will be used for players in the UK
#   - en.yml      ==>   Will be used for english speaker players whose specific location is not implemented.
# Under the same example, if a client's language is set to "en_AU", it'll use the "en.yml" translation, unless
#you specifically add a "en_AU.yml" file with its own translation. The same is true for all other languages.

#If no translation is found for a given language at oll. The language set at the "default_language" setting in
#the "config.yml" file will be used. Make sure there's a file in the /lang directory already with named after
#the default language code.

#Each translation item might have or not a set of parameters. These are fields defined by the '%' symbol.
#They are replaced in runtime by actual variable data. Each entry will have its own parameters linked to a
#'%' index.
